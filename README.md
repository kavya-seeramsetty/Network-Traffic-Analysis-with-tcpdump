# Network-Traffic-Analysis-with-tcpdump
This project demonstrates how to capture, filter, and analyze network traffic using the `tcpdump` tool. By employing a series of `tcpdump` commands, this project allows for the observation of various network protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and ICMP, providing insights into how data is transmitted over the network.
